File: Scrap_News_Send_Summary_via_GMail.py
=======
A little function to web-scrap news with Requests and BeautifulSoup in Python.
It visits the landing page of an online newspaper, reads out all story titles and its hyperlinks, follows these hyperlinks and gets all paragraphs of each story.
Finally everything is appended to a list and this list is pasted into an E-Mail send via GMail/yagmail.
Schedule this script daily to retrieve an overview of daily news.
The format is simply readable withput falling into distraction.
